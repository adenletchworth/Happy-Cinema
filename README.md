# Happy Cinema

## Description
Happy Cinema is **currently** a Movie Recommendation Application. You can either search for a current movie using the search feature, or manually enter qualities of your desired movie. The application will then recommend the most similar movie that you can currently watch in theatres or at home. The project uses web scraping for the search feature which can return any movie that has existed. It also uses web scraping to create the recommended movie database however that is limited to movies at home and in theatres. The recommendation compares the similarity of both genre and description using Natural Language Processing and gives a similarity score weighted on both features.
