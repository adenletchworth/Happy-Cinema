# Movie-Reccomender-System

In this project I will be scraping movie data from the website Rotten Tomatoes. With this data I will be building a reccomender system to give reccomendations based on movies attributes. Some of these attributes include Rating, Genre and Director too name a few. In the final stages of this project I would be implementing an interface for ease of use.
